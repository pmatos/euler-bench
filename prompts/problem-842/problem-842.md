# Problem 842: Irregular Star Polygons

Given $n$ equally spaced points on a circle, we define an <span class="dfn">$n$-star polygon</span> as an $n$-gon having those $n$ points as vertices. Two $n$-star polygons differing by a rotation/reflection are considered **different**.

For example, there are twelve $5$-star polygons shown below.

For an $n$-star polygon $S$, let $I(S)$ be the number of its self intersection points.  
Let $T(n)$ be the sum of $I(S)$ over all $n$-star polygons $S$.  
For the example above $T(5) = 20$ because in total there are $20$ self intersection points.

Some star polygons may have intersection points made from more than two lines. These are only counted once. For example, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">$S$,</span> shown below is one of the sixty $6$-star polygons. This one has $I(S) = 4$.

You are also given that $T(8) = 14640$.

Find $\displaystyle \sum\_{n = 3}^{60}T(n)$. Give your answer modulo $(10^9 + 7)$.
