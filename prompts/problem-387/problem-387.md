# Problem 387: Harshad Numbers

A **Harshad or Niven number** is a number that is divisible by the sum of its digits.  
$201$ is a Harshad number because it is divisible by $3$ (the sum of its digits.)  
When we truncate the last digit from $201$, we get $20$, which is a Harshad number.  
When we truncate the last digit from $20$, we get $2$, which is also a Harshad number.  
Let's call a Harshad number that, while recursively truncating the last digit, always results in a Harshad number a <span class="dfn">right truncatable Harshad number</span>.

Also:  
$201/3=67$ which is prime.  
Let's call a Harshad number that, when divided by the sum of its digits, results in a prime a <span class="dfn">strong Harshad number</span>.

Now take the number $2011$ which is prime.  
When we truncate the last digit from it we get $201$, a strong Harshad number that is also right truncatable.  
Let's call such primes <span class="dfn">strong, right truncatable Harshad primes</span>.

You are given that the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less than $10000$ is $90619$.

Find the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less than $10^{14}$.
